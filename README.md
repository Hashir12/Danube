# Pre-Interview Project

To run the project, please follow these steps:

1. First, create a database named `pre_interview`.
2. Import the SQL file `database/pre_interview.sql` into your newly created `pre_interview` database. This file contains the necessary table structures.
3. Now, you can run the `index.php` file to start the project.

That's it! You should now be able to access the project and interact with it.
